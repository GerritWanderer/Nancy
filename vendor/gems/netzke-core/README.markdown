## Netzke Core

Netzke Core is the bare bones of the [Netzke framework](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke). For pre-built full-featured components (like grids, forms, tab/accordion panels, applications, etc), see [netzke-basepack](http://github.com/skozlov/netzke-basepack) (Ext JS).

Netzke Core takes the burden of implementing the following key aspects of the framework:

* JavaScript class generation
* Client-server communication
* Extendibility of components (with OOP, in both Ruby and JavaScript)
* Unlimited nesting (composition)
* Dynamic component loading
* JavaScript class caching
* Inclusion of “external” JavaScript CSS files
* ... and more

All this provides for fast, low-traffic, robust, highly maintainable applications.

### Getting started

* Follow the simple [installation](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke-core/wiki/Installation) steps.
* Learn how to build the [Hello World!](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke-core/wiki/Hello-world-extjs) component.
* Dive into the [documentation](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke/wiki).
* Get help on the [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/netzke).

### Sencha Touch support

Netzke Core has support for Sencha Touch, so you can create components for mobile web apps as easily.

* Learn how to build the [Hello World!](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke-core/wiki/Hello-world-touch) Sencha Touch component.

### Testing and playing with Netzke Core

Netzke Core is bundled with Cucumber and RSpec tests. If you would like to contribute to the project, you may want to learn how to [run the tests](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke-core/wiki/Automated-testing).

Besides, the bundled test application is a convenient [playground](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke-core/wiki/Playground) for those who search to experiment with the framework.
