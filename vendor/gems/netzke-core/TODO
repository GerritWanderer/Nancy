= Ideas that didn't work out

== Making value from super-class accessible in the block parameters in endpoints, e.g.:

    endpoint :call_server do |params, orig|
      orig.merge(:set_title => orig[:set_title] + " extended")
    end

Bad idea because calling the super method is often required AFTER doing something in the override, not BEFORE. For example, deliver_component in GridPanel in Basepack is overridden to reconfigure the components on the fly before actually delivering the component (i.e. calling super).
So, to override an endpoint, simply define a method with endpoint's name, e.g.:

    def call_server(params)
      super.merge(...)
    end
